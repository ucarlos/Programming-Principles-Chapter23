* Chapter 23
This repository contains solutions to some problems from Bjarne Stroustrup's Principles of Programming Using C++ (2014). These solutions were written on a Linux machine, but should work on Windows and macOS since it only uses the standard C++ library.

** Requirements
+ A C++ Compiler that supports C++11
+ CMake in order to build the project
